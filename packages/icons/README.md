# Ultraviolet Icons

[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/%40ultraviolet%2Ficons.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/%40ultraviolet%2Ficons)

Ultraviolet Icons is a set of components based on SVG icons. It provides a set of icons that can be used in your projects.

## Get Started

```sh
$ pnpm add @ultraviolet/icons @ultraviolet/themes
```

You can then add `ThemeProvider` to your applications and use the provided theme from `@ultraviolet/themes` or use your own.

```tsx
import { ThemeProvider } from '@emotion/react'
import { SdkGoProductIcon } from '@ultraviolet/icons/product'
import { theme } from '@ultraviolet/themes'

const App = () => (
  <ThemeProvider theme={theme}>
    <SdkGoProductIcon size="medium" variant="primary"/>
  </ThemeProvider>
)
```

> **Note**:
> To generate your own theme easily you can check the [theme generator](https://storybook.ultraviolet.scaleway.com/?path=/docs/tools-theme-generator--docs).

N.B. To allow typescript theme typings with `@emotion/styled` components,
you'll have to define the `@emotion/react` module `Theme` interface in your project.

Example, in a `emotion.d.ts` file:

```ts
import '@emotion/react'
import type { consoleLightTheme } from '@ultraviolet/themes'

type UltravioletUITheme = typeof consoleLightTheme

declare module '@emotion/react' {
  export interface Theme extends UltravioletUITheme {}
}
```
