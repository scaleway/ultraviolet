# Welcome to Ultraviolet UI

We rely heavily on jest and snapshots to ensure our components behaviour and output are correct

### Rule of thumb

We tend towards 100% of coverage, this won't be able to cover all edge cases and behavior, but it's a good start to avoid regressions and improve confidence in the codebase. Thus, all introduced code or feature must have corresponding test cases

## Quick start

Every js files inside a `__tests__` folder will be executed

```sh
$ pnpm run test # Will run all tests
$ pnpm run test --updateSnapshot # Will update all snapshots
$ pnpm run test:watch # Will watch tests and only rerun the one who are modified
$ pnpm run test:coverage # Will generate a coverage report
$ pnpm run test:coverage --coverageReporters lcov && open coverage/lcov-report/index.html # Will generate an open an html code coverage report
```

## Testing behavior (click, hover, input, ...)

You can use [`@testing-library/user-event`](https://testing-library.com/docs/ecosystem-user-event/) or `fireEvent` from [`@testing-library/react`](https://testing-library.com/docs/dom-testing-library/api-events/) to trigger events

As stated in [`@testing-library/react`](https://testing-library.com/docs/dom-testing-library/api-events/) documentation you should favor [`@testing-library/user-event`](https://testing-library.com/docs/ecosystem-user-event/) whenever possible

## Helpers

### `renderWithTheme(component, options, theme = defaultTheme)`

This will wrap the provided node with an emotion ThemeProvider and render it

This is useful when you need to dig through a rendered node

```jsx
test(`click checkbox`, async () => {
  const node = renderWithTheme(<input role="checkbox" />)

  const input = node.getByRole('checkbox')
  await userEvent.click(input)
  expect(input.getAttribute('aria-checked')).toBe('true')
})
```

* `component`: A valid React Node
* `options`: [@testing-library/react options](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/api/#render-options)
* `theme`: A theme available as an object, you can find an example in `src/theme`

### `shouldMatchEmotionSnapshot(component, options = {})`

This will wrap the provided node with an emotion ThemeProvider, render it and snapshot it at the end of the execution

> âš  This is an async function and need to be either in an async function or directly returned to jest

```jsx
test(`click and snapshot checkbox`, async () =>
  shouldMatchEmotionSnapshot(<input role="checkbox" />, {
    transform: async ({ getByRole }) => {
      const input = getByRole('checkbox')
      await userEvent.click(input)
    },
  }))
```

* `component`: A valid React Node
* `options`: `{ options, transform, theme } = {}`
  * `options`: [@testing-library/react options](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/api/#render-options)
  * `theme`: A theme available as an object, you can find an example in `src/theme`
  * `transform`: an async function receiving in parameters the rendered node. This can be used to apply transformation to the component before snapshotting

### `shouldMatchEmotionSnapshotWithPortal(component, options = {})`

This is a variation of `shouldMatchEmotionSnapshot` which bind the node to `document.body` in order to be able to test components with Portals

```jsx
test(`renders with Modal`, () =>
  shouldMatchEmotionSnapshotWithPortal(
    <Modal>
      <div>test</div>
    </Modal>,
  ))
```
