# Illustrations V2

## How to use @ultraviolet/illustrations

Assets are now imported directly from an S3 bucket in order to reduce the size of the package. 

**Path to the components changed**. Although `@ultraviolet/illustrations/components/DynamicIllustration` is still supported, **a simpler way to import it was added**: to use `<DynamicIllustration />` simply write 
```javascript
import { DynamicIllustration } from '@ultraviolet/illustrations'
```

The path to import illustrations did not change.
For example:

```javascript
import { notFound } from '@ultraviolet/illustrations/various/feedback'
```

A typo was corrected on quantum, make sure to import `quantumOriginal` and not `quantumOrignal`

## How to add illustrations to the package
Simply add the illustrations you want to add to the correct folder and simply create a PR. Once the branch is approved and merged, they will be automatically added to the bucket and exported.

To add the new assets to `<DynamicIllustration />`, follow the same steps but before creating the PR, do not forget to add the light and dark version of the new illustrations to src/components/DynamicIllustration/Illustrations.tsx.
