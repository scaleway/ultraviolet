# Migrate NumberInput to NumberInputV2

## Properties to migrate

* `minValue` (string) -> `min` ( number)
* `maxValue` (string) -> `max` ( number)
* `step` (string) -> `step` (string | number)
* `value` (string) -> `value` (number)
* `text` (string) -> `unit` (string)
* `disabledTooltip` (string) -> `tooltip` (string)

## Removed properties

* `onMaxCrossed` (function)
* `onMinCrossed` (function)
* `defaultValue` (string)

## Behavior change

* The component act as uncontrolled component as long as the `value` prop is not provided.
  If you set `value`, you will have to handle the `onChange` event to update the value.

* If you set a `min` or `max` value and that the component is controlled (you set the `value` prop).

* <b>âš  WARNING:</b> If the `min` or `max` prop is set in addition with `step` prop
  you need to be coherent in the number you are setting up. If the `step` is a multiple
  of 5 then you need to set your `min` or `max` to be also a multiple of 5.

* If the input is empty the `onChange` will receive `null` as value
