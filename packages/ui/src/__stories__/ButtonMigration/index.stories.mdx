## Variants match

## Size match

<ThemeWrapper>
  <Sizes />
</ThemeWrapper>

## Others Old/New props matching

- `progress` &rarr; : Loader (if prop `isLoading` if provided) replaces or use the `icon` spot. If you have no icon you can still use `iconPosition="right"` to put the Loader on the right.

---

- `as` &rarr; : ButtonV2 do not support `as` prop and always renders a button expect if you provide an href then an anchor will be rendered.

---

- `tooltip` &rarr; : ButtonV2 do not support `tooltip` prop. Please wrap your button with the `Tooltip` component.

---

- `action` &rarr; : ButtonV2 do not support `support` prop. Simply provide an `icon` without `children`.

---

- `extend` &rarr; : We removed this behavior, we recommand to still use a `icon` + `text (children)`..

---

- `iconSize` &rarr; : ButtonV2 do not support `iconSize` prop, the icon size is define internally depending of variant/size to make it consistent.
