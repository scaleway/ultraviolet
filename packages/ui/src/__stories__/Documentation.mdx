# Documentation Guidelines

This page explains what are the guidelines for writing documentation for components as a maintainer.

## Folder and files structure

First of all, you need to understand how is structured our current stories. We have a folder for each component,
and inside of it, we have a folder for stories and a file for each story. If we take the example of Button component
here is how the folder should look alike:

```bash
Button
├── __stories__
│   ├── index.stories.tsx
│   ├── Template.stories.tsx
│   ├── Playground.stories.tsx
```

***

`index.stories.tsx` contains exports of each story and the parameters for the component story page. Here is an example with just Playground story:

```tsx
import type { Meta } from '@storybook/react-vite'
import { Button } from '..'

export default {
  component: Button,
  decorators: [
    StoryComponent => (
      <div style={{ display: 'flex', gap: 16 }}>
        <StoryComponent />
      </div>
    ),
  ],
  parameters: {
    docs: {
      description: {
        component: 'A button is a component used to define a call to action',
      },
    },
  },
  title: 'Components/Action/Button',
} as Meta<typeof Button>

export { Playground } from './Playground.stories'
```

Here we have the `component` parameter that is used to define the component that the story is related to. The `decorators`
parameter is used to define the decorators that will be applied to the story. The `parameters` parameter is used to define the parameters for the component story page.
The `title` parameter is used to define the title of the story.

***

`Template.stories.tsx` contains the default template of a story. If your story only change properties values you can use this template as base. Here is an example:

```tsx
import type { StoryFn } from '@storybook/react-vite'
import { Button } from '..'

export const Template: StoryFn<typeof Button> = ({ ...props }) => (
  <Button {...props} aria-label="test" />
)
```

***

`Playground.stories.tsx` contains the playground of a story. This story will be the one user will manually change properties on storybook itself. Here is an example:

```tsx
import { Template } from './Template.stories'

export const Playground = Template.bind({})

Playground.args = {
  children: 'Button text',
}
```

## How to write a story

Now that you understood how is structured our current stories, you can start writing your own story. Here are some guidelines to follow:

* The story should be written in a `.stories.tsx` file.
* The story should be exported in the `index.stories.tsx` file.
* The story should use the `Template` as base if it only changes properties values.

Then you can simply create your file, write your story and export it in the `index.stories.tsx` file.

## Custom behaviors

Maybe you noticed that some of our stories have deprecated or experimental state. This is because we have some custom behaviors, we customized storybook
page structure to add those status. Here is how to add those behaviors:

* To add a deprecated state, you need to add the `deprecated` parameter in the `index.stories.tsx` file. Here is an example:

```tsx
export default {
  component: Button,
  parameters: {
    docs: {
      description: {
        component: 'A button is a component used to define a call to action',
      },
    },
    deprecated: true,
    deprecatedReason: 'This component is deprecated please use ListV2 instead.', // You can also add a reason to be shown on the storybook page
    migrationLink: '?path=/docs/components-action-button--playground', // The link should be a storybook path
  },
  title: 'Components/Action/Button',
} as Meta<typeof Button>
```

* To add an experimental state, you need to add the `experimental` parameter in the `index.stories.tsx` file. Here is an example:

```tsx
export default {
  component: Button,
  parameters: {
    docs: {
      description: {
        component: 'A button is a component used to define a call to action',
      },
    },
    experimental: true,
  },
  title: 'Components/Action/Button',
} as Meta<typeof Button>
```
