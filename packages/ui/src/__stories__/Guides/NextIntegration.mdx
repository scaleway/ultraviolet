# Welcome to Ultraviolet UI

Learn how to use Ultraviolet UI with Next.js.

## App Router

This section will guide you through the integration of Ultraviolet UI with Next.js [App Router](https://nextjs.org/docs/app).

### Install dependencies

Start by installing Ultraviolet dependencies and emotion dependencies.

```sh
pnpm add @ultraviolet/ui @ultraviolet/themes @emotion/react @emotion/styled
```

### Configuration

Inside `app/layout.tsx`, import the `ThemeRegistry` from `@ultraviolet/ui` and wrap your app with it.

```tsx
// app/layout.tsx
import { consoleLightTheme } from '@ultraviolet/themes'
import { ThemeRegistry } from '@ultraviolet/ui'
import { ReactNode } from 'react'

export default function RootLayout({
  children,
}: Readonly<{
  children: ReactNode
}>) {
  return (
    <html lang="en">
      <body>
        <ThemeRegistry theme={consoleLightTheme}>
          {children}
        </ThemeRegistry>
      </body>
    </html>
  )
}
```

`ThemeRegistry` component is responsible for providing the theme context to all components within the app.
This component has been specially made to work seamlessly with Next.js's App Router.

### Limitations

- **Fonts**: Ultraviolet UI uses custom fonts that need to be imported separately. Make sure to import the fonts CSS file in your project's entry point:
  ```sh
  pnpm add @ultraviolet/fonts
  ```

  then in you `GlobalStyle` file:
  ```tsx
  "use client"

  import '@ultraviolet/fonts/fonts.css'
  ```

- **Styled Components**: in order to customize an emotion component, you need to import the `styled` function from `@emotion/styled` and use it to create your styled components. Emotion is not yet compatible with server components, so you need to use the `styled` function in a client component. Example:
  ```tsx
  "use client"

  import { styled } from '@emotion/styled'

  const Button = styled.button`
    background-color: #0070f3;
    color: white;
    padding: 10px 20px;
    border: none;
    border-radius: 4px;
    cursor: pointer;
  `
  ```
