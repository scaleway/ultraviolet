      story: `You can use the \`step\` prop to define the step of the input. In this example the step is set to \`10.5\` so the input will increment/decrement by 10.5.<br /><br />
      <b>⚠️WARNING:</b> If the \`min\` or \`max\` prop is set in addition with \`step\` prop you need to be coherent in the number you are setting up. If the \`step\` is a multiple of 5 then you need to set your \`min\` or \`max\` to be also a multiple of 5, or you will have incoherent behavior.`,
