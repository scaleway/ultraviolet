# Ultraviolet Themes

[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/%40ultraviolet%2Fthemes.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/%40ultraviolet%2Fthemes)

Ultraviolet Themes is a set of themes for the Ultraviolet UI library.

> [!NOTE] 
>
> `@ultraviolet/ui` is using `@ultraviolet/theme` under the hood, therefore you don't need to install it if you want to use the default theme (`consoleLightTheme` and `consoleDarkTheme` are the default themes).
> This package is only usefull if you want to use only `@ultraviolet/themes` without `@ultraviolet/ui` or if you want to create your own theme based on the existing ones.
