# Migrate SelectInput to SelectInputV2

Welcome to the migration of SelectInput into SelectInputV2, here we will see how to easily migrate to SelectInputV2 component.

## Properties to migrate

* `children` (ReactNode) => `options`{'(Record<string, OptionType[]> | OptionType[])'}
* `isDisabled`(boolean) => `disabled` (boolean)
* `emptyState`{'((obj: {inputValue: string;}) => ReactNode) '} => `emptyState` (ReactNode)
* `isSearchable` (boolean): `searchable` (boolean)
* `isClearable` (boolean): `clearable` (boolean)
* `inlineDescription` (string): `description`, defined directly in the options props
* `value`(string | selectOption): `value` (string[] | string)

## Removed Properties

* `additionalStyles` (CSSInterpolation)
* `checked` (boolean)
* `labelId` (string)
* `time` (boolean)
* `customStyle`: You can directly customize the options style by passing a ReactNode as a label for the options
* `animation` (string)
* `animationDuration` (number)
* `noTopLabel` (boolean): Simply do not pass a label
* `animationOnChange` (boolean)
* `customComponents`
* `loading`

## `options` prop

Options are now only passed as a prop, not children. They can be of two types, one for grouped options and one for ungrouped options. Each option is of type `OptionType` with the following properties:

* `value` (string): value of the option. *This prop is required*.
* `label` (ReactNode): label to display in the dropdown and on the selectBar when the option is selected. *This prop is required*.
* `disabled` (boolean): whether the option is disabled. *This prop is optional*.
* `description` (ReactNode): more information on the option. The description can be placed at the right or beneath the option label in the dropdown with the prop `direction`, which is **global**. When description is a string, it is also used when searching an option. *This prop is optional*.
* `optionalInfo` (ReactNode): if there is badges or icons to add next to the label (left or right) which are not meant to be visible when the option is selected. Its position is **globally** set using the prop `optionalInfoPlacement`. *This prop is optional*.
* `searchText` (string): define here what should the user search to get this option. This prop is optional when the label is a string, required otherwise.
* `tooltip` (string): If defined, a tooltip with the string defined will be shown when hovering the option in the dropdown. *This prop is optional*.
