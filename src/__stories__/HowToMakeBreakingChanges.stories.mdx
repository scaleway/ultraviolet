# How to make a breaking changes as a maintainer?

How to breaking change a component and what is the process of migration? That's what we will see in this documentation.

<br/>

## My component has breaking changes but can be easily migrated

It is okay to make breaking changes into a component but to do so you need to make documentation out of it. While making your PR
please explaining what is breaking with a detailed explanation. In this case we won't create a second version of the breaking component, a simple documentation will fit.

## My component has breaking changes, and we can't have a 1:1 easy migration path

This is the last solution to choose. Your breaking is so big that it couldn't be migrated easily, in this case you need to rename your component, two possibilities:
- Your component don't have a new name then you will need to add V2 in front of it. Example: You're refactoring Button so your component name should be ButtonV2.
- Your component already have a new name (ex: Switch becomes Toggle) then use the new name.

In this scenario both old and new components will coexist until the end of migration. Here are the step of the migration:

1. Step one, write a migration documentation. You should find a template into `src/__stories__/Migration` fill it according to new component specification and how to migrate old one.
This documentation is **REQUIRED** in order to merge your component.

2. Step two, the old component should be marked as deprecated in story.

    For stories, you can simply use the parameter `deprecated`, `deprecatedReason` and `migrationLink` into your story default export.
    `migrationLink` should be the link to your migration documentation for this component. It should look as follows:

    ```typescript
      export default {
        component: Button,
        parameters: {
          deprecated: true,
          deprecatedReason: 'This component is deprecated please do not use it any more.',
          migrationLink: '/?path=/docs/migration-typography-to-text--page'
        },
        title: 'Components/Button/Button',
      } as Meta
    ```

    This will add a badge and a message into your storybook documentation. It should look as follows:
    <img src="https://scaleway-ui-storybook-images.s3.fr-par.scw.cloud/Screenshot%202022-05-17%20at%2016.23.10.png" alt="deprecated example screenshot" width="1000px" />

3. Third step is to mark component deprecated trough JSDoc comments with a beautiful description on what to replace usage by. This should be shown in typescript hints. It should look as follows:

    ```tsx
      /**
       * @deprecated Has been replaced by component BetterButton, please this one instead.
       */
      const Button = props => (
          <div>
              This is supposed to be a button
          </div>
      )
    ```


4. Create your PR on GitHub.

5. Final step and most important one: the end of life of old component. You've finished your migration, so you should remove old component folder.
